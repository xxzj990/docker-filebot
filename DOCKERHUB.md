FileBot is the ultimate tool for organizing and renaming your movies, tv shows
or anime, and music well as downloading subtitles and artwork. It's smart and
just works.

## Quick Start

**NOTE**: The Docker command provided in this quick start is given as an example
and parameters should be adjusted to your need.

Launch the FileBot docker container with the following command:
```
docker run -d \
    --name=filebot \
    -p 5800:5800 \
    -v /docker/appdata/filebot:/config:rw \
    -v $HOME:/storage:rw \
    jlesage/filebot
```

Where:
  - `/docker/appdata/filebot`: This is where the application stores its configuration, log and any files needing persistency.
  - `$HOME`: This location contains files from your host that need to be accessible by the application.

Browse to `http://your-host-ip:5800` to access the FileBot GUI.
Files from the host appear under the `/storage` folder in the container.
